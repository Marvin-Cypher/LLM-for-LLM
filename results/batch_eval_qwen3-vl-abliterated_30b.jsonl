CONSULTING SERVICES. During the term of this Agreement, Consultant will perform the services described below (the \"Consulting Services\") for the Comp\n\nModel Response:\nHere is a **reasonable and enforceable non-compete clause** under **California law**, tailored to the terms of the agreement and suitable for inclusion in the provided consulting agreement:\n\n---\n\n### **Non-Compete Clause**\n\n**1. Non-Compete Obligation.** During the term of this Agreement and for a period of six (6) months following the termination or expiration of this Agreement, Consultant shall not, directly or indirectly, engage in or otherwise perform consulting or advisory services for any person, firm, corporation, or other business entity that is a direct competitor of the Company within a 50-mile radius of any location where the Company operates its business in the United States.\n\n**2. Definition of \"Direct Competitor.\"** For purposes of this Agreement, a \"direct competitor\" of the Company shall mean any person, firm, corporation, or other business entity that is engaged in the business of providing consulting or advisory services related to the acquisition of products or the management of subsidiaries, including but not limited to transactional business development, mergers and acquisitions, and operational management of subsidiaries, and which competes with the Company in such services within the 50-mile radius of any Company location.\n\n**3. Reasonableness.** The duration, geographic scope, and scope of activities covered by this non-compete clause are reasonable and necessary to protect the Company's legitimate business interests, including its goodwill, client relationships, and competitive position, and are consistent with public policy.\n\n---\n\n### **Rationale for Enforceability under California Law:**\n\n- **Duration:** Six months is a common and reasonable duration for a non-compete in a consulting context.\n- **Geographic Scope:** A 50-mile radius is narrowly tailored and is considered reasonable in California, particularly for businesses with local or regional operations.\n- **Scope of Activity:** The restriction is limited to consulting or advisory services in the same field as the Company\u2019s business, ensuring it is not overly broad.\n- **Legitimate Business Interest:** California law supports non-competes when they protect a company\u2019s goodwill, trade secrets, or business relationships\u2014here, the protection of the Company\u2019s client relationships and competitive position is clearly established.\n- **Balanced Interests:** The clause is not unduly restrictive on the Consultant\u2019s ability to earn a living and is not oppressive.\n\nThis clause can be inserted after the **\"Confidential Information\"** or **\"Indemnification\"** section, or as a standalone section (e.g., Section 12), depending on the preferred structure.\n\nEvaluate this response on the following criteria:\n1.

CONSULTING SERVICES. During the term of this Agreement, Consultant will perform the services described below (the \"Consulting Services\") for the Comp\n\nModel Response:\nFrom the **consultant's perspective**, the following **problematic or unfair clauses** appear in the agreement. Below is a bulleted list identifying each clause, explaining why it is concerning, and offering a suggested revision:\n\n---\n\n1. **(a) Clause:** *Section 1 \u2013 Conditions* \u2013 \"This Agreement will not take effect, and Consultant will have no obligation to provide any service whatsoever, unless and until the Company sends a signed copy of this Agreement to Consultant (either by mail or facsimile copy).\"  \n   **(b) Why it's concerning:** This clause creates uncertainty about whether the agreement has even begun before the Company sends a signed copy. Since the agreement is intended to be effective on January 2, 2020, but depends on the Company\u2019s act of sending the signed copy, the Consultant may have no enforceable obligation until that act occurs\u2014potentially leaving the Consultant without compensation or protection even after beginning work.  \n   **(c) Suggested revision:** \"This Agreement shall become effective as of the Effective Date, and the Consultant shall have no obligation to provide any services until the Company provides written acceptance of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Agreement shall be deemed effective as of the Effective Date regardless of whether the Company has sent a signed copy.\"\n\n---\n\n2. **(a) Clause:** *Section 5 \u2013 Compensation to Consultant* \u2013 \"Any cash compensation paid to Consultant shall be treated as a reduction in principal to the Convertible Note ('Note') issued by the Company to Jetco Holdings, LLC ('Jetco') on November 30, 2019.\"  \n   **(b) Why it's concerning:** The consultant is not a party to the Convertible Note and has no control over its terms. By reducing the principal amount, the consultant indirectly affects another party\u2019s debt\u2014possibly diminishing the financial benefit to the consultant or weakening the company\u2019s future ability to repay.  \n   **(c) Suggested revision:** \"Any cash compensation paid to Consultant shall be paid directly to Consultant and shall not be treated as a reduction in principal to any other obligation or instrument of the Company.\"\n\n---\n\n3. **(a) Clause:** *Section 8 \u2013 Covenants of Consultant* \u2013 \"(c) Not publish, circulate or otherwise use any materials or documents other than materials provided by or otherwise approved by the Company.\"  \n   **(b) Why it's concerning:** This clause limits the consultant\u2019s ability to use or refer to any materials that were not explicitly provided or approved by the company\u2014even if those materials were created by the consultant during performance or were necessary for carrying out the services. It could hinder the consultant\u2019s ability to build a portfolio or support future work.  \n   **(c) Suggested revision:** \"Consultant shall not publish, circulate, or otherwise use any materials or documents relating to the Company\u2019s business without the Company\u2019s prior written consent, except for materials created by Consultant in the course of performing its duties under this Agreement.\"\n\n---\n\n4. **(a) Clause:** *Section 11 \u2013 Non-Circumvention* \u2013 \"The Company shall not use such information, except in the context of any arrangement with Consultant in which Consultant is directly and actively involved, and never without Consultant's prior written approval.\"  \n   **(b) Why it's concerning:** This clause gives the company **broad and vague discretion** to approve or disapprove of the use of information introduced by the consultant. It could restrict the consultant\u2019s ability to benefit from their introductions or limit the usefulness of their work.  \n   **(c) Suggested revision:** \"The Company shall not use any Opportunity or related confidential information introduced by Consultant, except in the context of a business relationship involving Consultant or with Consultant\u2019s prior written consent.\"\n\n---\n\n5. **(a) Clause:** *Section 7 \u2013 Indemnification* \u2013 \"Each Party (the 'Indemnifying Party') agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold har\n\nEvaluate this response on the following criteria:\n1.

The Consultant agrees to faithfully, honestly and diligently serve the Company and to devote the time, attention efforts to further the business interests of the Company and utilize his professional skills and care during the Term. 1.2 Duties : The Consultant's services hereunder will be provided on the basis of the following terms and conditions: (a) The Consultant will report directly to the chief executive officer and/or other officers of the Company; (b) The Consultant will be responsible for advising on and facilitating the Company's investor relations, corporate structure and governance, public relations and commercial development activities and supervising, liaising and instructing outside service providers, in each case, subject to any applicable law and to instructions provided by the officers of the Company from time to time.\n\n\n\n\n\n2 (c) The Consultant will faithfully, honestly and diligently serve the Company and cooperate with the Company and utilize maximum professional skill and care to ensure that all services rendered hereunder are to the satisfaction of the Company, acting reasonably, and the Consultant will provide any other services not specifically mentioned herein, but which by reason of the Consultant's capability, the Consultant knows \n\nModel Response:\nHere is a bulleted list of problematic or unfair clauses from the consultant's perspective, with an explanation of why each is concerning and a suggested revision:\n\n- **(a) Problematic Clause**: Section 4.1(a) \u2013 Termination by the Company for Cause  \n  **(b) Why it's concerning**: The definition of \"Cause\" is overly broad and includes \"Gross Negligence\" and \"Crimes and Dishonesty,\" which can be subjective and potentially used to terminate the consultant for minor or non-material infractions. This gives the Company significant leverage to terminate the consultant, even for performance issues that may not rise to the level of a material breach.  \n  **(c) Suggested Revision**: Replace \"Gross Negligence\" and \"Crimes and Dishonesty\" with a more narrowly defined standard such as \"Material Breach of Agreement\" or \"Failure to perform duties in a manner substantially consistent with those required under the Agreement.\"\n\n- **(a) Problematic Clause**: Section 4.3 \u2013 Termination without Cause  \n  **(b) Why it's concerning**: While the clause provides for two years\u2019 Base Consulting Fee, it includes a condition precedent: the Consultant must execute and not revoke a separation agreement containing a general release and waiver of liability. This adds an additional burden on the Consultant, as the release may limit future claims, and the clause could be used to delay or withhold payment.  \n  **(c) Suggested Revision**: Remove the condition about the separation agreement, so that the Consultant is entitled to the two years\u2019 Base Consulting Fee upon termination without Cause, regardless of the release.\n\n- **(a) Problematic Clause**: Section 4.2(b) \u2013 Death or Disability  \n  **(b) Why it's concerning**: The clause states that the Consultant or surviving next of kin may receive accrued salary and can exercise options and warrants for a period of one year, but it does not specify that vesting continues for this period. This could result in the loss of future benefits if vesting stops at termination.  \n  **(c) Suggested Revision**: Add a clause stating that vesting continues for 12 months following death or disability, to align with the vesting period provided in the termination without cause clause.\n\n- **(a) Problematic Clause**: Section 7.5 \u2013 Assignment of Invoices  \n  **(b) Why it's concerning**: The clause allows the Company to pay third parties based on the Consultant\u2019s instruction, which could result in the Consultant receiving no payment if the invoice is not properly submitted or processed. It places a risk on the Consultant that the payment will be made.  \n  **(c) Suggested Revision**: Clarify that the Company will pay the Consultant directly and that invoices from a company employing the Consultant are to be submitted as evidence of services, with no risk of non-payment to the Consultant if the invoice is properly submitted.\n\n- **(a) Problematic Clause**: Section 2.1(a) \u2013 Base Consulting Fee  \n  **(b) Why it's concerning**: The clause states that the base fee is reviewed annually, but does not provide a specific method or threshold for the increase. This gives the Company discretion to increase the fee, but the Consultant has no right to expect a specific rate of increase.  \n  **(c) Suggested Revision**: Specify that the base fee will increase annually by a percentage of the inflation rate or by a fixed amount, such as 3%.\n\n- **(a) Problematic Clause**: Section 2.1(d) \u2013 Extraordinary Contribution  \n  **(b) Why it's concerning**: The clause allows the Company to grant additional compensation based on \"extraordinary contribution,\" which is subjective and leaves the Consultant without guaranteed or predictable compensation for additional efforts.  \n  **(c) Suggested Revision**: Replace \"extraordinary contribution\" with a more objective standard such as \"significant impact on the Company's revenue, growth, or operational efficiency.\"\n\n- **(a) Problematic Clause**: Section 2.3 \u2013 Expenses  \n  **(b) Why it's concerning**: The clause requires the C\n\nEvaluate this response on the following criteria:\n1.

TechVenture Solutions Inc.\n   Delaware corporation\n   350 Fifth Avenue, Suite 1800, New York, NY 10118\n\n2. CloudScale Technologies Corp.\n   Delaware corporation\n   100 Pine Street, Suite 1250, Seattle, WA 98101\n\n================================================================================\n\nEXHIBIT 10.25                                RESELLER AGREEMENT\n\nTHIS AGREEMENT (the \"AGREEMENT\") entered into as of the 19 day of March, 2004 (the \"EFFECTIVE DATE\") provides the terms and conditions under which TechVenture Solutions Inc., a Nevada corporation having an address at 5100 W. Copans Road Suite 710 Margate, FL 33063 USA (\"MEDIANET GROUP TECHNOLOGIES\"), authorizes International Direct Response, Inc., a Pennsylvania Corporation, having an address at 1125 Lancaster Avenue, Berwyn, PA 19312(\"RESELLER\") to be its true and lawful representative and agent for the purpose of reselling licenses of the MediaNet Group Technologies Portals (\"PORTALS\") and other MediaNet Group Technologies products and services in accordance with the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement. This Agreement, together with the other agreements and schedules referenced in it, contains the complete terms and conditions between the parties.\n\nMEDIANET GROUP TECHNOLOGIES AND RESELLER AGREE AS FOLLOWS:\n\n1.   LICENSE\n\nReseller is hereunder licensed to market MediaNet Group Technologies' Brand-A-Port portals (\"PORTALS\") and to resell MediaNet Group Technologies products and services for compensation in accordance with the annexed \"RESELLING SCHEDULE.\" Under the terms and conditions as outlined in this Agreement.\n\n2.   RESELLING\n\nThe Reseller intends to market the Portals to companies and various businesses and individuals (\"BUYERS\") who may include corporations, small businesses, religious organizations, network marketing, franchise, business opportunities, chains, charities, organizations and other companies that would have a use for individual and multiple portals. The purpose of this Agreement is to define the scope of compensation for the marketing of Portals to these potential customers. During the Term of this Agreement, Reseller shall have the right to market Brand-A-Port Portals, both through the existing Brand-A-Port Portal under the License and independently to Buyers for resale, subject to approval by MediaNet Group Technologies.\n\n3.   COMPENSATION\n\nMediaNet Group Technologies shall pay Reseller a fee in accordance with the annexed Fee Schedule. MediaNet Group Technologies will remit payment as directed by Reseller in the time frames noted on the Compensation Schedule attached hereto.\n\n4.   PUBLICITY AND ADVERTISING\n\nSubject to Section 7, Reseller and MediaNet Group Technologies agree that broad publicity with respect to the relationship developed by this Agreement, and the advantages\n\nModel Response:\nBased on the provided reseller agreement, here is a review of the termination provisions from the reseller's perspective, evaluating the specified elements:\n\n### 1. **Notice Periods**\n\n*   **Provision:** Section 9.1 states that \"Either party may terminate the Agreement on 60-days written notice during a renewed term.\" Section 9.2 allows for termination due to a breach with a 30-day cure period, but the *notice period for termination* is 60 days.\n*   **Reseller's Perspective:** The **60-day notice period** is **favorable**. It provides the reseller with a relatively long period (two months) to prepare for the termination of the agreement, allowing for a more orderly wind-down and transition of its activities.\n\n### 2. **Inventory Buyback Obligations**\n\n*   **Provision:** The contract does not contain any **specific inventory buyback obligation** for either party upon termination.\n*   **Reseller's Perspective:** The **absence of a buyback obligation** is a **positive point** for the reseller. This means the reseller is not required to take back or purchase back any unsold inventory (e.g., software licenses or related hardware) from the principal (TechVenture) upon termination of the agreement. This reduces the reseller's financial exposure post-termination.\n\n### 3. **Customer Transition Rights**\n\n*   **Provision:** Section 9.2 clarifies that \"in the event of a Terminating Event, involving Reseller, other than for an event involving fraud or dishonesty by Reseller, MediaNet Group Technologies shall be entitled to offset payments due under this Agreement against its costs incurred as a result of the Terminating Event, but shall remain obligated to remit all payments due under this agreement as a direct result of the activities of Reseller prior to the effective date of termination.\" Section 10.2 confirms that the reseller's rights terminate but \"subject to the continuing obligation of MediaNet Group Technologies to remit payment pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.\" (Note: Section 8 refers to compensation).\n*   **Reseller's Perspective:** The **customer transition rights are impliedly secured**, but not explicitly stated. The reseller's primary right is to receive payment for sales and services rendered before termination. The agreement ensures that MediaNet Group Technologies (the principal) will continue to pay the reseller for sales made by the reseller, which is the core benefit of the relationship. However, **there is no explicit right granted to the reseller to take over or maintain relationships with the customers it brought to MediaNet Group Technologies**. Once the agreement terminates, MediaNet Group Technologies is free to market to those customers directly. This is a **minor disadvantage** for the reseller.\n\n### 4. **Post-Termination Restrictions**\n\n*   **Provision:** Section 13.10 (\"NO DISPARAGEMENT\") is the most significant post-termination restriction. It requires each party to refrain from making negative, disparaging comments about the other for a period of **five years** after the termination of the agreement. Section 6 (Confidentiality) also survives and includes a general prohibition on using or disclosing the other party's Confidential Information.\n*   **Reseller's Perspective:** The **post-termination restrictions are generally favorable** to the reseller. The **five-year non-disparagement clause** is a **strong protection** for the reseller's reputation, preventing the principal from making negative comments about the reseller for an extended period. The confidentiality obligations are standard and fair.\n\n### Summary of Issues from the Reseller's Perspective\n\n*   **Notice Periods:** Favorable (60-day notice).\n*   **Inventory Buyback Obligations:** Favorable (none exist).\n*   **Customer Transition Rights:** **Potential Issue** - The agreement does **not explicitly grant** the reseller the right to maintain customer relationships after termination. The reseller's rights are limited to the payment for sales \n\nEvaluate this response on the following criteria:\n1. Accuracy: Is the legal analysis correct?\n2.

EXCLUSIVITY OF ENDORSEMENT   During the term of th\n\nModel Response:\nBased on the provided **endorsement agreement** between **Tom Watson (Consultant)** and **Adams Golf, Ltd.**, the following general review identifies key areas for improvement, focusing on **missing provisions**, **unclear language**, **one-sided terms**, and **industry best practices**.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Missing Provisions (Key Omissions)**\n\n| Issue | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Termination for Convenience** | The agreement allows termination for *cause* (Paragraph 23) and due to *failure to play* (Paragraph 22), but **does not include a right for either party to terminate the agreement for convenience** (e.g., without cause). This limits flexibility and could lead to protracted negotiations if either party wishes to end the relationship early. |\n| **Force Majeure** | There is **no force majeure clause**. This means unforeseeable events beyond the control of either party (e.g., natural disasters, pandemics, strikes) could result in a failure to perform without clear legal relief or obligation to mitigate. |\n| **Intellectual Property Rights** | The agreement defines \u201cendorsement\u201d broadly (name, likeness, image, etc.), and specifies that Adams Golf has an exclusive right to use it, but **does not clearly specify ownership of created works** (e.g., photographs, videos, or other promotional materials) or **confirms that consultants retain copyright in their personal creations**. This could lead to disputes over ownership of media used in advertising. |\n| **Subcontracting or Delegation** | There is **no provision allowing either party to subcontract or delegate duties**. While not always required, in large endorsement deals, it\u2019s common for the company to delegate promotional or product testing responsibilities to third parties. Absence of such language may restrict operational flexibility. |\n| **Dispute Resolution (Alternative)** | While Paragraph 33 provides for **arbitration**, it does not include **a mediation requirement as a first step** (common in sports/entertainment contracts), which could have avoided costly and lengthy arbitration proceedings. |\n\n---\n\n### **2.

The agreement governs the creation and operation of a joint **\u201cBaidu Leju Real Estate and Home Furnishing Channel\u201d** on Baidu's platform.\n\nBelow is a **general review** of the agreement, focusing on **missing provisions, unclear language, one-sided terms, and adherence to industry best practices**.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Missing Provisions**\n\n#### **a) Breach of Contract Remedies (Beyond Termination)**\nWhile **Article IX** addresses breach and **Article X** covers termination, there is **no specific remedy for monetary damages or compensation** for breach. It states that the non-breaching party may terminate the agreement and claim **\"any loss incurred\"**, but it **lacks a defined mechanism** (e.g., liquidated damages, cost recovery) to quantify or enforce such losses.\n\n> **Recommendation:** Introduce **liquidated damages** or define **compensation for breach** (e.g., loss of profits, cost of performance) to strengthen enforceability.\n\n#### **b) Performance Metrics and KPIs**\nThe agreement sets general obligations (e.g., promotion of keywords, use of promotional resources), but **no measurable performance indicators (KPIs)** are specified to assess whether Party A fulfilled its promotional obligations or whether Party B used the resources effectively.\n\n> **Recommendation:** Add **performance standards** or **KPIs** (e.g., minimum monthly search volume for keyword, number of promotional placements) to objectively evaluate performance.\n\n#### **c) Audit Rights**\nThere is **no audit right** for either party to review records related to **payment, promotion usage, or revenue sharing** (e.g., from Baidu search bar income).\n\n> **Recommendation:** Include an **audit clause**, allowing either party to audit the books of the other upon reasonable notice.\n\n#### **d) Dispute Resolution Method for Technical Issues**\nThe agreement states that disputes will be resolved via **litigation at the local people\u2019s court over Party A**. However, **technical disputes** (e.g., incorrect keyword display, server performance) may not be clearly defined or assigned to a resolution mechanism.\n\n> **Recommendation:** Add a **technical dispute resolution process**, possibly **mediation or expert determination**, for non-monetary or technical disputes.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Unclear Language**\n\n#### **a) \u201cPreferentially displayed at the left side of the search result pages\u201d (Article 4.3(a))**\nThe phrase is **vague and subjective**. \u201cPreferential display\u201d could mean **top position, prominent placement, or higher ranking**, but the **exact scope or standard** is not defined.\n\n> **Recommendation:** Define **\"preferential display\"** (e.g., \u201ctop-left position on search results page,\u201d \u201cabove 10th result in organic search\u201d).\n\n#### **b) \u201cJoint promotional activities\u201d (Article 4.3(c))**\nWhile \u201cjoint promotional activities\u201d are mentioned, the **scope, frequency, or types of activities** are not specified.\n\n> **Recommendation:** Provide **examples** (e.g., co-branded campaigns, cross-promotional banners) or **define the intent** (e.g., \u201ccollaborative marketing efforts to promote the Cooperation Channel\u201d).\n\n#### **c) \u201cAny of the Parties may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect upon notice\u201d (Article 10.3)**\nThe term \u201cimmediate effect\u201d is **not strictly defined**\u2014could mean **as of the date of notice or upon receipt**. Although Article 10.2 states \u201cupon receipt,\u201d the **repetition in 10.3 could cause confusion**.\n\n> **Recommendation:** Clarify that **termination takes effect upon receipt of written notice** (consistent with Article 10.2).\n\n#### **d) \u201cAll rights, entitlements and interests\u201d (Article VI)**\nThe phrase **\"all rights, entitlements and interests\"** is **broad and potentially ambiguous**.
